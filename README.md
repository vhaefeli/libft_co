# libft_co
the libft and useful includes

The libft is the first project of the school 42 programm. Because we can use some fonctions we have to recode them. 
After, we make more and more fonctions that are very usefull and can be add to our library. 
Here you have the actual version I use = not the one asked for the libft project.
I also add some .h files full of "define" that can be usefull
